Code and data repository for the "Principles for coding associative memories in a compact neural network" manuscript

The data can be found at the osf repository: https://osf.io/5v4qu/

Directory structure (mirrored in the linked OSF repository):

"chemotaxis behavior" contains the code for the graphs in Figure 1
"activity data butanone" holds the code for the graphs in Figure 3
"activity data butanone diacetyl exchange" holds the code for the graphs in Figure 4 and 5 (code). In the subdirectories "classification", "regression", and "PCA", contain the code for classification in Figure 4, the multivariate regression of Figure 6, and the PCA in Figure 7.
"chemotaxis behavior" contains the code for the graphs in Figure 8
"image minig" contains the code for image mining.
